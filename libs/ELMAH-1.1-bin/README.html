        ELMAH README</h1>
    <p>
        Please read this document carefully before using this release of ELMAH
        as it contains important information.</p>
    <p>
        For peer help and support, vists the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/elmah">ELMAH Discussion Group</a>.
        Report bugs and issues to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/issues/list">issue
        tracker</a> on the <a href="http://elmah.googlecode.com/">project site</a>.
        Avoid using the issue tracker to seek help with problems you are experiencing in
        installing or running ELMAH. That is what the discussion group is for.</p>
    <p>
        The best way to get started with ELMAH is to take it for a spin by launching
        the supplied demo Web site. Simply go the root of your ELMAH distribution and
        execute the <code>demo.cmd</code> script. The demo Web site requires 
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa731542.aspx">Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0</a>.

    <h2>
        Version 1.0 BETA 3 Notes</h2>
    <h3>
        Upgrading from ELMAH 1.0 BETA 2(a)</h3>
    <h4>
        Microsoft SQL Server Error Log</h4>
    <p>
        If you are using the Microsoft SQL Server (2000 or later) for your error log then you should re-create 
        the stored procedures found in the supplied SQL script (see <code>SQLServer.sql</code>).
        The script does not contain DDL <code>DROP</code> or <code>ALTER </code> statements so 
        you will have to drop the stored procedures manually before applying the 
        <code>CREATE PROCEDURE</code> parts of the script. Other than that, there have been no 
        changes to the schema since BETA 2a so existing data in your logs can be left as it is.</p>
    <h4>
        Oracle Error Log</h4>
    <p>
        The Oracle error log is new in BETA 3, but if you have been compiling ELMAH
        from sources between BETA 2 and 3 and using Oracle for your error log then you should re-create
        the  <code>ELMAH$Error</code>  table,  its  indicies and related packages using  the
        supplied SQL script (see <code>Oracle.sql</code> in your distribution). The  script
        does  not contain  any <code>DROP</code>  statements so  you  will have to drop the 
        table and package  manually before applying  the  script.  If you wish
        to preserve the logged error data, you should consider archiving it in
        a backup. Please  read the comments in this script file carefully  for
        hints on users and synonyms. NB The original package has now been split in two to aid in
        securing the database in enterprise scenarios.</p>
    <h4>
        VistaDB Error Log</h4>
    <p>
        The VistaDB error log is new in BETA 3, but if you have been compiling
        ELMAH from  sources  between  BETA  2 and 3 and using VistaDB for your
        error log  then  you  should  delete the <code>.vdb3</code> file and allow it to be
        re-created.</p>
    <h4>
        Microsoft Access Error Log</h4>
    <p>
        The Access error log is new in BETA 3, but if you have been  compiling
        ELMAH  from  sources  between  BETA  2 and 3 and using Access for your
        error  log  then  you  should  delete the <code>.mdb</code> file and allow it to be
        re-created.</p>
   
    <h2>
        Version 1.0 BETA 2(a) Notes</h2>
    <h3>
        Upgrading from GDN-ELMAH or ELMAH 1.0 BETA 1</h3>
    <p>
        The configuration sections and entries have changed slightly if you are
        using GDN-ELMAH, which is the original that was released on GotDotNet. 
        Consult the <code>samples/web.config</code> file to see examples of 
        how the configuration looks like now.</p>
    <p>
        If you are using the Microsoft SQL Server for your error log then you should re-create 
        the <code>ELMAH_Error</code> table, its indicies and related stored procedures
        using the supplied SQL script (see  <code>Database.sql</code> in your distribution).
        The script does not contain DDL <code>DROP</code> statements so you will have to drop
        the table and stored procedures manually before applying the script. If you wish to
        preserve the logged error data, you should consider archiving it in a backup.
